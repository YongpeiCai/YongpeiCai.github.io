There have been a dizzy array of guides out there about how to construct an academic webpage. If you're already chilling with RStudio and RMarkdown, one popular path is to use `blogdown`. Check out Allison Hill's blog post, ["Up&Running with Blogdown in 2021"](https://www.apreshill.com/blog/2020-12-new-year-new-blogdown/). You might hit a couple of bumps, especially with all the Git-related stuff. Personally, I found solutions either in ["Happy Git with R"](https://happygitwithr.com/) by Jenny Bryan et al or just by doing some google internet searches. 

If reading isn't your thing, no worries! I stumbled upon some really helpful YouTube videos that might be more up your alley:

If you're aiming for a hassle-free way to set up your academic website, consider creating a repository from a template you discover on GitHub. One of the most popular route on the internet is to the fork the repository from https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io and follow the instructions laid out in the README.md file. While creating a repository from a template shares similarities with forking, it's essential to note some key differences. Check out the [GitHub Doc](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) for a breakdown of these distinctions. :

* A new fork includes the entire commit history of the parent repository, while a repository created from a template starts with a single commit.
* Commits to a fork don't appear in your contributions graph, while commits to a repository created from a template do appear in your contribution graph.
* A fork can be a temporary way to contribute code to an existing project, while creating a repository from a template starts a new project quickly.

Here is the resources for this approach

Later, I discovered that connecting GitHub and GitHub Desktop is a much smoother experience. In RStudio, troubleshooting was a bit tricky, especially when dealing with issues like pushing a committed file that's too large. GitHub Desktop, on the other hand, provides a more intuitive way to handle such situations. Plus, it's straightforward to access the GitHub repo page directly through GitHub Desktop. Here is the most effective workflow summarized by Shinichi Nakagawa in his [post](https://www.i-deel.org/blog/using-github-desktop-to-work-with-rstudio-and-github):
1. Create a GitHub repo on the GitHub webpage (my profile page).
2. Clone the repo my computer using GitHub Desktop to create a local folder (note that you need to log in GitHub Desktop using your GitHub username and password).
3. Open a RStudio project using this local folder.
4. Then, you can just use RStudio normally but commit, push, and pull using GitHub Desktop.
Here is the recommended tutorial that you navigate the Github destop:
