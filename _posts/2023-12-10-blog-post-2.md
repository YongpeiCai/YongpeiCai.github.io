Suppose you want to buy a $350,000 house, and you plan to get a 30-year fixed mortage (annual quoted rate = 6%) with a 20% down payment. Whatâ€™s your monthly repayment? How much of it will go towards interest and how much will go towards the principal?

It's crucial to note that, in Canada, all mortgages (excluding variable rate mortgages) are compounded semi-annually by law. Thus, a mortgage quoted at 6% will have an annual effective rate of 6.09%, based on a 3% semi-annual rate:

$$( 1 + 0.03)^2 -1 = 0.0609 $$

However, you make your interest payments monthly, so your mortgage lender needs to use a monthly rate based on an annual rate that is less than 6%. Why? Because this rate will get compounded monthly. Therefore, we need to find the rate that compounded monthly, results in an effective annual rate of 6.09%. Mathematically, this would be:

$$(1+ r_M)^{12} -1 = 0.0609$$

$$r_M = (1.0609)^{\frac 1 {12}}$$

$$r_M = 0.00493862...$$

$$0.493862 x 12 = 5.926%$$ 

In other words, 5.926% compounded monthly is 6.09% annually. 

## Calculate the Present Value of Annuity

$$PV = \frac{C}{r} - \frac{C}{r} \times \frac{1}{(1+r)^T} = C \times \frac{1}{r}[1-\frac{1}{(1+r)^T}] $$

where PV is the loan amount ($350,000 $\times$ (1-20%)), C is the fixed mortgage payment (unknown), r is the effective annual rate (in this case, 6.09%), and T is the number of year (30 years).

## R code

```{R}
library(FinancialMath)

tab1 <- amort.table(Loan=280000,n=360, i=0.06,ic=2,pf=12,plot=FALSE)  

```

Over the 30-year amortization period, you will: 

- have made 360 monthly (12x per year) payments of $1,665.51.
- have paid $280,000.00 in principal, $319,582.01 in interest, for a total of $599,582.01.
