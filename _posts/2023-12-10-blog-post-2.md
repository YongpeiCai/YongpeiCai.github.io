Imagine you're eyeing this $600,000 house, right? Now, you're thinking, "Let's do this! I'll grab a 30-year fixed mortgage with an annual rate of 6%, and I'll throw down a 20% down payment." But then, the real questions hit you: What's the monthly hit gonna be? And how much of that is heading to interest, and how much is actually chipping away at the house itself? Curious, right?

It's crucial to note that, in Canada, all mortgages (excluding variable rate mortgages) are compounded semi-annually by law. Thus, a mortgage quoted at 6% will have an annual effective rate of 6.09%, based on a 3% semi-annual rate:

$$( 1 + 0.03)^2 -1 = 0.0609 $$

However, you make your interest payments monthly, so your mortgage lender needs to use a monthly rate based on an annual rate that is less than 6%. Why? Because this rate will get compounded monthly. Therefore, we need to find the rate that compounded monthly, results in an effective annual rate of 6.09%. Mathematically, this would be:

$$(1+ r_M)^{12} -1 = 0.0609$$

$$r_M = (1.0609)^{\frac 1 {12}}$$

$$r_M = 0.00493862...$$

$$0.493862 x 12 = 5.926%$$ 

In other words, 5.926% compounded monthly is 6.09% annually. 

## Calculate the Present Value of Annuity

$$PV = \frac{C}{r} - \frac{C}{r} \times \frac{1}{(1+r)^T} = C \times \frac{1}{r}[1-\frac{1}{(1+r)^T}] $$

where PV is the loan amount ($350,000 $\times$ (1-20%)), C is the fixed mortgage payment (unknown), r is the effective annual rate (in this case, 6.09%), and T is the number of year (30 years).

## R code

```{R}
library(FinancialMath)

tab1 <- amort.table(Loan=280000,n=360, i=0.06,ic=2,pf=12,plot=FALSE)  

```

Over the 30-year amortization period, you will: 

- have made 360 monthly (12x per year) payments of $1,665.51.
- have paid $280,000.00 in principal, $319,582.01 in interest, for a total of $599,582.01.
